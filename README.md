# Web Core Material

This course material will serve as lessons in HTML5 and CSS3. Each lesson is broken down into individual folders with corresponding markdown files. The main index will cover the initial start and will include all the navigation for each lesson as they are being build.

While javascript is a primary use in web development, this course material does not focus on many javascript fundamentals. Included in this material will be exercises to help reinforce each lesson. Try them out on your own and check your work with the exercises in this repository.
